.SH NAME
jltcdump \- JACK LTC decoder
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jltcdump
[ \fIOPTIONS \fR] [ \fIJACK-PORTS \fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
jltcdump \- JACK app to parse linear time code.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fps\fR
<num>[/den]     set expected [initial] framerate (default 25/1)
.TP
\fB\-F\fR
autodetect framerate from LTC
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR <path>
write to file(s)
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-signals\fR
start/stop parser using SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
parse R/S signal on 2nd channel
.TP
\fB\-R\fR
<float>                R/S signal threshold (default 0.02)
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print version information and exit
.PP
If both \fB\-s\fR and \fB\-o\fR are given, <path> is used a prefix:
The filename will be <path>YYMMDD\-HHMMSS.tme.XXXXX .
If only \fB\-o\fR is set, <path> is as filename.
.PP
In 'signal' mode, the application starts in 'idle' state
and won't record LTC until it receives SIGUSR1.
.PP
The fps option is only needed to properly track the first LTC frame,
and timecode discontinuity notification.
The LTC\-decoder detects and tracks the speed but it takes a few samples
to establish initial synchronization. Setting fps to the expected fps
speeds up the initial sync process. The default is 25/1.
