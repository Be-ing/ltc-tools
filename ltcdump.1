Channel count starts at '1', which is also the default channel to analyze.
The fps option is only needed to properly track the first LTC frame.
The LTC\-decoder detects and tracks the speed but it takes a few samples
to establish initial synchronization. Setting fps to the expected fps
speeds up the initial sync process. The default is 25/1.
